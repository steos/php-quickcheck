# PHPQuickCheck

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/steos/php-quickcheck.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/steos/php-quickcheck)

PHPQuickCheck is a generative testing library for PHP based on
clojure.test.check.

> Don't write tests. Generate them. - John Hughes

## Huh?

Generative testing, also called property-based testing, is about
describing the behaviour of your system in terms of properties that
should hold true for all possible input.

### Quickstart

Install PHPQuickCheck:

```
composer require steos/quickcheck --dev
```

Create a property test `test/stringsAreNeverNumeric.php`:

```php
<?php
use QuickCheck\Generator as Gen;
use QuickCheck\Test;

Test::forAll(
    [Gen::asciiStrings()],
    function($str) {
        return !is_numeric($str);
    }
);
```

And run quickcheck against it:

```
$> vendor/bin/quickcheck test/stringsAreNeverNumeric.php -t 1000
```

```
PHPQuickCheck 2.0.0. Don't write tests. Generate them.

### xdebug

PHPQuickCheck uses a lot of functional programming techniques which leads to a lot of nested functions.
With xdebug default settings it can quickly lead to this error:

```
Error: Maximum function nesting level of '256' reached, aborting!
```

This happens due to the infinite recursion protection setting `xdebug.max_nesting_level`.
Best is to disable this or set it to a high value.
The phpunit config sets it to `9999`.

### Performance

- Disable xdebug to get tests to run faster. It has a huge impact on the runtime performance.

- Use the GMP extension. The RNG will use the gmp functions if available. Otherwise it falls back to very slow bit-fiddling in php userland.

## Project Status

PHPQuickCheck is somewhat experimental. The core functionality of clojure.test.check (v0.5.9, August 2014) has been implemented.
There have been a number of improvements to clojure.test.check since the initial port which have not been implemented yet.

### Contributing

All contributions are welcome.

Feel free to fork and send a pull request. If you intend to make
major changes please get in touch, so we can coordinate our efforts.

#### Dev Setup

The repository contains a Dockerfile to quickly set up a dev environment.
It is based on the `php:7.4.1-cli` image and adds xdebug, gmp and composer.

```
$ docker build -t php-quickcheck-dev dev-env
$ docker run --rm -it --mount src=$(pwd),target=/quickcheck,type=bind php-quickcheck-dev bash
# cd /quickcheck
# composer install
# vendor/bin/phpunit
# bin/quickcheck examples
```

The image also contains a small script `toggle-ext` to toggle php extensions on and off:

```
root@c871096e2c92:/quickcheck# toggle-ext xdebug
xdebug is now disabled
root@c871096e2c92:/quickcheck#
```

## Credits

All credit goes to clojure.test.check, this project is mostly just a port.

## Requirements

Requires PHP 7.4.x with 64 bit integers. The gmp extension is recommended but not required.
